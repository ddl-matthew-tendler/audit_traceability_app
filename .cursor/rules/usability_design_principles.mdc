# Domino Design System Guidelines

> Source: [Domino Design System Guidelines Wiki](https://dominodatalab.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PDT/pages/2997682182/Design+system+guidelines)

Welcome to the Domino Design System (DDS) documentation — a guide to the design principles, components, and patterns that shape Domino's user experience. These guidelines are essential for designers, developers, and product managers to create consistent, user-friendly interfaces aligned with Domino's vision and values.

## Core Design Philosophy

- Follow **atomic design methodology**
- Use **Ant Design** as the base component library
- Refer to **Storybook** for additional developer resources

# Domino's UX Principles

Domino's UX Principles are guidelines for how we build Domino's user experience. These principles are created for designers, product managers, and engineers to use when making decisions and creating solutions to customer problems.

## 1. Pave a Smooth Path

**Support users through an opinionated experience that helps them achieve their goals directly and reliably vs forcing users to figure it out on their own.**

### Examples:
- Don't drop the user into the platform without orienting them and setting up the right expectations of the platform
- If a task is easier to complete with the Domino UI, don't force users to complete the task using the API or their terminal if they are currently in the Domino UI
- Lean on the API experience intentionally rather than as a replacement for creating its UI counterpart
- Give guidance on next steps by explaining what to do with the output of an action so that users aren't stuck at a dead end
- Organize tools around user goals and workflows so that users can complete a task seamlessly
- Explain concepts in-page where the user is with descriptions, tooltips, popovers, and info icons, instead of forcing them to figure them out on their own or jumping between the developer docs and the platform
- Anticipate that not all users will know how and when to use the tools in Domino

### Metrics of Success:
- Increase of models being built
- Increase workflow completion (workflows dependent on feature areas)
- Positive sentiment on Domino helping DSPs achieve their day-to-day goals

## 2. Increase User Confidence

**Communicate transparently and implement consistent patterns to increase user confidence in using Domino vs assuming users can infer what's not communicated and don't notice the details.**

### Examples:
- Write detailed error messages that give the reasons why the error occurred and how to resolve it
- When choosing to display disabled states or disabled features, explain why they are disabled and what to do to enable them
- Give feedback through micro-animations or status messages to indicate the action the user took was recognized
- Use correct grammar and spelling
- Design with and implement the same design language, terms and vocabulary, and branding for a consistent user experience
- Implement shared components so interactions and expected behaviors are consistent for the user

### Metrics of Success:
- Increase of models being built
- Increase workflow completion (workflows dependent on feature areas)
- Reduced number of support tickets on why a feature isn't available
- Reduced number of support tickets on confusion on the expected behavior of a UI interaction
- Reduced number of support tickets that could have been self-served

## 3. Reduce Effort to Value

**Automate steps and reduce cognitive load as much as possible vs requiring users to put in effort for the benefit of Domino. Prioritize automating steps that Domino is confident in getting correct, are low in risk, and are easy for the user to change.**

### Examples:
- Present only the necessary information to help users make the right choice to complete the step
- Use progressive disclosure to help users through options that are advanced or unlikely to be used first
- Automate steps that have low value compared to user effort
- Default configurations and settings based on what we know about the user and that are easy for users to edit
- Reduce cognitive load by presenting information at the moment when it's applicable to the user's action vs presenting the information too early and all at once

### Metrics of Success:
- Increase of models being built
- Increase workflow completion (workflows dependent on feature areas)
- Positive sentiment on Domino helping DSPs achieve their day-to-day goals
- Reduced time to completion on configurations and set up
- Reduced time it takes users to start using Domino (create a project, launch a Workspace)

---

## 4. Adapt to Repeat Users

**Design for the repeat, intermediate user vs treating all users as forever first time users. Create experiences that set the user up for success and then get out of their way.**

### Examples:
- Use an "Onboarding" and "Sideboarding" approach to teach users about a new feature. Onboard users to a new feature with the information they need to get started. Progressively guide them through the next steps (Sideboarding)
- Onboard users, not the project. Make content dynamic to first time users vs returning users since projects may have multiple collaborators
- Allow users to opt out of warning messages that can be triggered each time the user takes an intentional action: "Don't show me this again when I do X"
- If applicable, allow keyboard shortcuts and keyboard accessibility on repeat actions like browsing through files or rows
- If certain information, like a help text, is only useful after the first exposure, design for it to go away to reduce noise during repeat usage

### Metrics of Success:
- Increase of models being built
- Increase workflow completion (workflows dependent on feature areas)
- Increase repeat and long-term usage of Domino

# UX Design Checklist (Helpers)

Use these questions as a checklist when designing and reviewing UI:

- [ ] Is it clear what the user should do at each step?
- [ ] Are choices easy to understand and supported with explanations if they aren't?
- [ ] Are there designs and copy for unsuccessful states?
- [ ] Are there designs and copy for empty states?
- [ ] Is the layout checked on wide and mid screen sizes (laptop vs wide monitors)?
- [ ] Is the copy checked for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization on Domino terms (Workspace and Model API are capitalized, Artifacts is plural and capitalized)?
- [ ] Is the design using the DDS library?
- [ ] Are colors, fonts, interactions, and images accessible?
- [ ] Are the terms and language used understandable to a non-data scientist?
- [ ] Does the solution consider how users can achieve their goals proactively and reactively?
- [ ] Did you take into consideration the inputs the user needs to accomplish the step and the output it will generate?
- [ ] Did you try to break the product while QA'ing?

# UX Writing Guidelines

> Source: [UX Writing Wiki](https://dominodatalab.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PDT/pages/3056599056/UX+writing)

Clear, concise, and thoughtful language is just as essential to user experience as visual design and interaction patterns. This guide establishes best practices for writing in all user-facing text.

## General Principles

- **Be concise** – Remove unnecessary words while maintaining clarity
- **Avoid ambiguity** – Ensure users immediately understand the message
- **Write in active voice** – e.g. 'Save changes' instead of 'Changes can be saved'
- **Use familiar words** – Avoid jargon and technical terms unless necessary
- **Guide users, don't just inform them** – Offer clear next steps or actions, rather than simply stating a fact (e.g. 'Your password is incorrect. Try again or reset your password.' instead of just 'Invalid password')
- **Maintain consistency** – Use the same terms for actions, objects, and features across the product

## Style Guide & Formatting

### Capitalization
- Default to **sentence case** in most scenarios
- **Good:** "Filter by date" | **Bad:** "Filter by Date"
- **Exceptions:**
  - User-created entities should maintain casing as entered by the user
  - Domino or externally branded terms (Workspace, Model API, Artifacts, etc.)

### Punctuation
- Include punctuation only at the end of complete sentences
- Do not use exclamation points
- Use contractions for a natural, conversational tone
- Use ampersands (&) only in space-constrained UI elements (otherwise, spell out "and" for readability)

### Numbers
- Use numerals and symbols ('3%') instead of spelling them out ('three percent')
- Use 'fewer than' for countable items and 'less than' for measurements
  - **Good:** 'fewer than 10 files' and 'less than 5GB of storage'

### Datetime
- Use 'Month Day, Year' format (e.g. February 25, 2025) to avoid ambiguity across regions
- Use relative dates (e.g. '2 days ago') in situations where users need to quickly understand when something happened
- In general, don't use relative dates past 7 days

## Errors & Status Messages

**First and foremost, prevent user errors when possible** – If you're adding an error message, explore ways to prevent the error from occurring at all.

### If you must include an error message:
- Be direct, concise, and speak directly to the user
- Provide actions to resolve when possible
- Avoid adding unnecessary or unactionable anxiety
- Avoid unnecessary apologies or warnings, especially regarding issues unlikely to have significant impact

### Examples:

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| "Unable to allocate resources to run your workspace. Try again in a few minutes, or contact your admin to increase available resources." | "The workspace most likely seems to have failed to get properly assigned compute resources at this time." |
| "Average response time: 650ms" | "Average response time: 650ms. WARNING: due to sampling and/or rounding as well as mathematical outliers, this may not represent the experience of all user transactions." |

## Accessibility & Inclusivity

- Write for screen readers (avoid 'read more,' use descriptive links)
- Avoid culturally specific idioms or slang
- Use gender-neutral language

## Word Catalog

Ensures consistency of usage across different product contexts.

| Word | Usage |
|------|-------|
| **Add** | Use when the entity exists and is being added to a new application (e.g. adding a user to a Project). Do not use "new" in front of "add" (redundant). |
| **Create** | Use when the user is creating an entity that does not yet exist in the system (e.g. creating a user profile). Do not use "new" in front of "create" (redundant). |
| **Performance** | Use to describe metrics relating to deployment integrity (e.g. model quality, data drift). |
| **System health** | Use to describe metrics relating to system-level behavior (e.g. CPU/GPU/memory consumption, latency, error rate). |
| **Usage** | Use to describe metrics relating to consumer usage of a deployment (e.g. Apps views). |
