# Domino Design System Guidelines

> Source: [Domino Design System Guidelines Wiki](https://dominodatalab.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PDT/pages/2997682182/Design+system+guidelines)

Welcome to the Domino Design System (DDS) documentation — a guide to the design principles, components, and patterns that shape Domino's user experience. These guidelines are essential for designers, developers, and product managers to create consistent, user-friendly interfaces aligned with Domino's vision and values.

## Core Design Philosophy

- Follow **atomic design methodology**
- Use **Ant Design** as the base component library
- Refer to **Storybook** for additional developer resources

---

# Domino's UX Principles

Domino's UX Principles are guidelines for how we build Domino's user experience. These principles are created for designers, product managers, and engineers to use when making decisions and creating solutions to customer problems.

## 1. Pave a Smooth Path

**Support users through an opinionated experience that helps them achieve their goals directly and reliably vs forcing users to figure it out on their own.**

### Examples:
- Don't drop the user into the platform without orienting them and setting up the right expectations of the platform
- If a task is easier to complete with the Domino UI, don't force users to complete the task using the API or their terminal if they are currently in the Domino UI
- Lean on the API experience intentionally rather than as a replacement for creating its UI counterpart
- Give guidance on next steps by explaining what to do with the output of an action so that users aren't stuck at a dead end
- Organize tools around user goals and workflows so that users can complete a task seamlessly
- Explain concepts in-page where the user is with descriptions, tooltips, popovers, and info icons, instead of forcing them to figure them out on their own or jumping between the developer docs and the platform
- Anticipate that not all users will know how and when to use the tools in Domino

### Metrics of Success:
- Increase of models being built
- Increase workflow completion (workflows dependent on feature areas)
- Positive sentiment on Domino helping DSPs achieve their day-to-day goals

---

## 2. Increase User Confidence

**Communicate transparently and implement consistent patterns to increase user confidence in using Domino vs assuming users can infer what's not communicated and don't notice the details.**

### Examples:
- Write detailed error messages that give the reasons why the error occurred and how to resolve it
- When choosing to display disabled states or disabled features, explain why they are disabled and what to do to enable them
- Give feedback through micro-animations or status messages to indicate the action the user took was recognized
- Use correct grammar and spelling
- Design with and implement the same design language, terms and vocabulary, and branding for a consistent user experience
- Implement shared components so interactions and expected behaviors are consistent for the user

### Metrics of Success:
- Increase of models being built
- Increase workflow completion (workflows dependent on feature areas)
- Reduced number of support tickets on why a feature isn't available
- Reduced number of support tickets on confusion on the expected behavior of a UI interaction
- Reduced number of support tickets that could have been self-served

---

## 3. Reduce Effort to Value

**Automate steps and reduce cognitive load as much as possible vs requiring users to put in effort for the benefit of Domino. Prioritize automating steps that Domino is confident in getting correct, are low in risk, and are easy for the user to change.**

### Examples:
- Present only the necessary information to help users make the right choice to complete the step
- Use progressive disclosure to help users through options that are advanced or unlikely to be used first
- Automate steps that have low value compared to user effort
- Default configurations and settings based on what we know about the user and that are easy for users to edit
- Reduce cognitive load by presenting information at the moment when it's applicable to the user's action vs presenting the information too early and all at once

### Metrics of Success:
- Increase of models being built
- Increase workflow completion (workflows dependent on feature areas)
- Positive sentiment on Domino helping DSPs achieve their day-to-day goals
- Reduced time to completion on configurations and set up
- Reduced time it takes users to start using Domino (create a project, launch a Workspace)

---

## 4. Adapt to Repeat Users

**Design for the repeat, intermediate user vs treating all users as forever first time users. Create experiences that set the user up for success and then get out of their way.**

### Examples:
- Use an "Onboarding" and "Sideboarding" approach to teach users about a new feature. Onboard users to a new feature with the information they need to get started. Progressively guide them through the next steps (Sideboarding)
- Onboard users, not the project. Make content dynamic to first time users vs returning users since projects may have multiple collaborators
- Allow users to opt out of warning messages that can be triggered each time the user takes an intentional action: "Don't show me this again when I do X"
- If applicable, allow keyboard shortcuts and keyboard accessibility on repeat actions like browsing through files or rows
- If certain information, like a help text, is only useful after the first exposure, design for it to go away to reduce noise during repeat usage

### Metrics of Success:
- Increase of models being built
- Increase workflow completion (workflows dependent on feature areas)
- Increase repeat and long-term usage of Domino

# UX Design Checklist (Helpers)

Use these questions as a checklist when designing and reviewing UI:

- [ ] Is it clear what the user should do at each step?
- [ ] Are choices easy to understand and supported with explanations if they aren't?
- [ ] Are there designs and copy for unsuccessful states?
- [ ] Are there designs and copy for empty states?
- [ ] Is the layout checked on wide and mid screen sizes (laptop vs wide monitors)?
- [ ] Is the copy checked for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization on Domino terms (Workspace and Model API are capitalized, Artifacts is plural and capitalized)?
- [ ] Are colors, fonts, interactions, and images accessible?
- [ ] Are the terms and language used understandable to a non-data scientist?
- [ ] Does the solution consider how users can achieve their goals proactively and reactively?
- [ ] Did you take into consideration the inputs the user needs to accomplish the step and the output it will generate?
- [ ] Did you try to break the product while QA'ing?

# UX Writing Guidelines

> Source: [UX Writing Wiki](https://dominodatalab.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PDT/pages/3056599056/UX+writing)

Clear, concise, and thoughtful language is just as essential to user experience as visual design and interaction patterns. This guide establishes best practices for writing in all user-facing text.

## General Principles

- **Be concise** – Remove unnecessary words while maintaining clarity
- **Avoid ambiguity** – Ensure users immediately understand the message
- **Write in active voice** – e.g. 'Save changes' instead of 'Changes can be saved'
- **Use familiar words** – Avoid jargon and technical terms unless necessary
- **Guide users, don't just inform them** – Offer clear next steps or actions, rather than simply stating a fact (e.g. 'Your password is incorrect. Try again or reset your password.' instead of just 'Invalid password')
- **Maintain consistency** – Use the same terms for actions, objects, and features across the product

## Style Guide & Formatting

### Capitalization
- Default to **sentence case** in most scenarios
- **Good:** "Filter by date" | **Bad:** "Filter by Date"
- **Exceptions:**
  - User-created entities should maintain casing as entered by the user
  - Domino or externally branded terms (Workspace, Model API, Artifacts, etc.)

### Punctuation
- Include punctuation only at the end of complete sentences
- Do not use exclamation points
- Use contractions for a natural, conversational tone
- Use ampersands (&) only in space-constrained UI elements (otherwise, spell out "and" for readability)

### Numbers
- Use numerals and symbols ('3%') instead of spelling them out ('three percent')
- Use 'fewer than' for countable items and 'less than' for measurements
  - **Good:** 'fewer than 10 files' and 'less than 5GB of storage'

### Datetime
- Use 'Month Day, Year' format (e.g. February 25, 2025) to avoid ambiguity across regions
- Use relative dates (e.g. '2 days ago') in situations where users need to quickly understand when something happened
- In general, don't use relative dates past 7 days

## Errors & Status Messages

**First and foremost, prevent user errors when possible** – If you're adding an error message, explore ways to prevent the error from occurring at all.

### If you must include an error message:
- Be direct, concise, and speak directly to the user
- Provide actions to resolve when possible
- Avoid adding unnecessary or unactionable anxiety
- Avoid unnecessary apologies or warnings, especially regarding issues unlikely to have significant impact

### Examples:

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| "Unable to allocate resources to run your workspace. Try again in a few minutes, or contact your admin to increase available resources." | "The workspace most likely seems to have failed to get properly assigned compute resources at this time." |
| "Average response time: 650ms" | "Average response time: 650ms. WARNING: due to sampling and/or rounding as well as mathematical outliers, this may not represent the experience of all user transactions." |

## Accessibility & Inclusivity

- Write for screen readers (avoid 'read more,' use descriptive links)
- Avoid culturally specific idioms or slang
- Use gender-neutral language

## Word Catalog

Ensures consistency of usage across different product contexts.

| Word | Usage |
|------|-------|
| **Add** | Use when the entity exists and is being added to a new application (e.g. adding a user to a Project). Do not use "new" in front of "add" (redundant). |
| **Create** | Use when the user is creating an entity that does not yet exist in the system (e.g. creating a user profile). Do not use "new" in front of "create" (redundant). |
| **Performance** | Use to describe metrics relating to deployment integrity (e.g. model quality, data drift). |
| **System health** | Use to describe metrics relating to system-level behavior (e.g. CPU/GPU/memory consumption, latency, error rate). |
| **Usage** | Use to describe metrics relating to consumer usage of a deployment (e.g. Apps views). |

# General Usability Best Practices

## Fitts's Law (JESS TO TWEAK AND REF AA GUIDELINES)

Fitts's Law states that the time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target. Larger, closer targets are faster to click/tap.

### Key Principles:
- **Make targets large enough to click easily** – All interactive elements need adequate size (not about importance, but usability)
- **Reduce distance to frequent actions** – Place commonly used controls near the user's natural focus area
- **Utilize screen edges** – Elements at screen edges are easier to target (cursor stops naturally)
- **Group related actions together** – Reduces distance between sequential actions

### Minimum Size Recommendations:
- Touch targets: **minimum 44×44 pixels** for mobile/touch devices
- Click targets: **minimum 24×24 pixels** for desktop mouse interactions
- Provide adequate padding around small icons to increase the clickable area

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- Tiny touch targets on mobile (especially icon-only buttons)
- Insufficient padding around clickable elements
- Scattering related buttons across the screen
- Placing primary actions far from where users are focused

---

## UI Screens when possible should have a clear call to action 

This is achieved by using Primary vs Secondary button components, see our button components and guidelines in the storybook here: https://main--60c0de3f60dd96003bdcb1a1.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/components-actions-button--docs


---

## Visual Hierarchy & Layout

### Reading Patterns

**F-Pattern** (for text-heavy pages like articles, dashboards):
- Users scan the top horizontal line first
- Then move down the left side, occasionally reading across
- **Place key information** (headlines, navigation) along the top and left side

**Z-Pattern** (for minimal text, visual pages like landing pages):
- Eyes move: top-left → top-right → diagonal to bottom-left → bottom-right
- **Position key elements at Z-path points:**
  - Top-left: Logo/branding
  - Top-right: Navigation/secondary actions
  - Center: Main content
  - Bottom-right: Primary call to action

### Establishing Hierarchy

1. **Size** – Larger elements draw attention first
2. **Color & Contrast** – High contrast elements stand out
3. **Position** – Top-left is scanned first in LTR languages
4. **Whitespace** – Isolated elements with more whitespace appear more important
5. **Typography weight** – Bold text draws more attention than regular weight

---

## Typography & Font Hierarchy

A clear typographic hierarchy helps users scan content, understand structure, and find information quickly. Use consistent type styles across the product.

### Type Scale

Use a **modular scale** (ratio-based sizing) for consistent, harmonious typography. Common scales:
- **1.25 (Major Third)** – Subtle, good for dense UIs
- **1.333 (Perfect Fourth)** – Balanced, common for applications
- **1.5 (Perfect Fifth)** – More dramatic, good for marketing pages

**Example scale (base 16px, ratio 1.25):**
| Level | Size | Use |
|-------|------|-----|
| H1 | 32px (2rem) | Page titles |
| H2 | 26px (1.6rem) | Section headers |
| H3 | 20px (1.25rem) | Subsection headers |
| H4 | 16px (1rem) | Card titles, labels |
| Body | 14-16px | Primary content |
| Caption | 12px (0.75rem) | Helper text, metadata |
| Small | 11px (0.69rem) | Fine print, timestamps |

### Heading Hierarchy Rules

1. **Don't skip levels** – Go H1 → H2 → H3, not H1 → H3 (important for accessibility)
2. **One H1 per page** – The page title; everything else is H2 or below
3. **Headings describe content** – Scannable headings help users find what they need
4. **Consistent styling** – Same heading level = same visual treatment everywhere

### Weight & Style

| Weight | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| **Bold (600-700)** | Headings, labels, emphasis, important numbers |
| **Medium (500)** | Subheadings, navigation items, button text |
| **Regular (400)** | Body text, descriptions, form inputs |
| **Light (300)** | Large display text only (not for small sizes) |

### Contrast Through Typography

Create hierarchy without changing size by using:
- **Weight contrast** – Bold label + regular value
- **Color contrast** – Primary color for key info, muted gray for secondary
- **Case** – ALL CAPS for small labels (sparingly), sentence case for content
- **Style** – Italic for emphasis or metadata (use sparingly)

### Line Height (Leading)

| Text Type | Line Height |
|-----------|-------------|
| Headings | 1.1 – 1.3 (tighter) |
| Body text | 1.4 – 1.6 (comfortable reading) |
| Captions | 1.3 – 1.4 |

### Common Typography Mistakes

- ❌ Too many font sizes (stick to your type scale)
- ❌ Body text too small (minimum 14px for UI, 16px preferred)
- ❌ Insufficient contrast between heading levels
- ❌ Using light weight fonts at small sizes (illegible)
- ❌ Line lengths too long (aim for 50-75 characters per line)
- ❌ Centered body text (hard to read; left-align instead)

### Typography for Data

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Numbers in tables** | Use tabular/monospace figures for alignment |
| **Large numbers** | Add thousand separators (1,234,567) |
| **Units** | Smaller or lighter weight than the number |
| **Trends (+/-)** | Use color + icon, not just symbols |
| **Empty/null values** | Use "—" or "N/A", not "0" or blank |

---

## Whitespace & Grouping

### Law of Proximity (Gestalt Principle)
**Elements that are close together are perceived as related.** Use whitespace strategically to create visual groups.

### Guidelines:
- **Group related controls together** – Form fields that belong together should be visually clustered
- **Separate unrelated sections** – Use more whitespace between distinct sections than within sections
- **Consistent spacing scale** – Use a spacing system (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px) for predictable rhythm
- **Card patterns** – Use cards to group related content and create clear boundaries
- **Section dividers** – Use subtle lines or background colors to separate major sections

### The 1:2 Ratio Rule:
- Space **within** a group should be approximately **half** the space **between** groups
- This creates clear visual separation without explicit borders

---

## Alignment

### Principles:
- **Align elements to a grid** – Creates visual order and professionalism
- **Left-align text** in LTR languages for readability (avoid centered body text)
- **Align form labels consistently** – Either all left-aligned or all right-aligned
- **Align related data in tables** – Numbers should be right-aligned, text left-aligned
- **Align action buttons** – Consistent button placement across similar views (e.g., always bottom-right for modals)

### Common Alignment Patterns:
- **Form labels**: Left-aligned labels above fields, or right-aligned labels beside fields
- **Modal actions**: Primary action on the right, secondary (Cancel) on the left
- **Page actions**: Primary actions in top-right or prominent position

---

## Calls to Action (CTAs)

> See also: [Button Hierarchy (Primary / Secondary / Tertiary)](#button-hierarchy-primary--secondary--tertiary) for button styling guidelines.

### Button Labeling

Use clear, action-oriented labels that describe what will happen:

| Bad | Good | Why |
|-----|------|-----|
| "OK" | "Save changes" | Specific about what happens |
| "Submit" | "Create project" | Names the action and object |
| "Click here" | "View documentation" | Descriptive, accessible |
| "Delete" | "Delete project" | Includes the object being deleted |
| "Yes" / "No" | "Delete" / "Keep" | Action-oriented, not just confirmation |

### Labeling Guidelines:
- **Start with a verb** – "Save", "Delete", "Export", "Create"
- **Be specific** – Include the object when helpful ("Delete project" not just "Delete")
- **Match the trigger** – If user clicked "Edit profile", the save button should say "Save profile"
- **Avoid jargon** – "Submit" is vague; prefer specific actions

### Disable vs. Hide

| Approach | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Disable** (grayed out) | Action exists but isn't available yet (e.g., "Save" when form is incomplete) |
| **Hide** | User will never need this action (e.g., admin-only actions for regular users) |
| **Show with explanation** | Action unavailable with a reason (tooltip or helper text explaining why) |

- Disabled buttons should have a tooltip explaining why they're disabled
- Don't hide actions and then show them unexpectedly—users should understand what's possible

---

## Content Positioning

### Where to Put Important Content:

| Position | Best For | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| **Top-left** | Logo, navigation, page title | First scanned area (F-pattern) |
| **Top-right** | User menu, notifications, global actions | Expected location for account/settings |
| **Above the fold** | Key messages, primary CTA | Visible without scrolling |
| **Left sidebar** | Navigation, filters | Persistent access while viewing content |
| **Right sidebar** | Contextual info, help, related items | Secondary information area |
| **Bottom of forms** | Submit/Cancel buttons | Natural flow after completing fields |

### Mobile Considerations:
- **Thumb zone** – Place primary actions within easy thumb reach (bottom of screen)
- **Bottom navigation** – Most important nav items should be easily tappable
- **Avoid top corners** – Difficult to reach with one hand on large phones

---

## Error Handling

### Error Message Principles:

1. **Be human-readable** – Write errors in plain language, not technical jargon
2. **Explain what happened** – "Your session expired" not "Error 401"
3. **Tell users what to do next** – "Sign in again to continue"
4. **Be specific** – "Password must be at least 8 characters" not "Invalid password"
5. **Don't blame the user** – "We couldn't find that page" not "You entered a wrong URL"

### Error Placement:

| Error Type | Placement | When to Use |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Inline validation** | Next to the field | Form field errors (preferred) |
| **Inline banner** | Top of form/section | Multiple related errors, form submission failures |
| **Toast notification** | Corner of screen | Async errors, background failures, non-blocking issues |
| **Modal dialog** | Center of screen | Critical errors requiring immediate attention |
| **Full page** | Replace content | 404, 500, permission denied, maintenance |

### Inline Errors (Preferred):
- Show errors **immediately adjacent** to the problematic field
- Use **red color and error icon** for visibility
- Keep error text **concise but helpful**
- **Don't clear the user's input** – let them correct it

### Toast Notifications:
- Use for **async operations** (API failures, background sync issues)
- **Auto-dismiss** after 5-8 seconds for non-critical messages
- Provide a **dismiss button** for immediate closure
- Include **action buttons** when relevant ("Retry", "View details")
- **Stack multiple toasts** – don't overlap or replace

### Error Message Examples:

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "Error" | "Unable to save changes" |
| "Invalid input" | "Email address must include @" |
| "Request failed" | "Couldn't connect to server. Check your internet connection." |
| "Unauthorized" | "You don't have permission to view this. Contact your admin for access." |

## Data Visualization & Charts

### General Chart Principles:

1. **Choose the right chart type** for the data:
   - **Line charts**: Trends over time
   - **Bar charts**: Comparing categories
   - **Pie charts**: Parts of a whole (use sparingly, max 5-6 slices)
   - **Tables**: Precise values, comparisons across many dimensions

2. **Label clearly** – Title, axis labels, units, and legends should be unambiguous

3. **Don't distort data** – Start y-axis at zero for bar charts; be transparent about truncated axes

4. **Reduce chartjunk** – Remove unnecessary gridlines, 3D effects, and decorations

### Time Series Specific Rules:

- **Scale the time axis to the selected range** – If user selects "Last 7 days", show 7 days, not the full data range
- **Use consistent time intervals** – Don't stretch/compress irregular intervals
- **Handle missing data transparently** – Show gaps or clearly indicate interpolation
- **Use relative dates for recent data** – "2 hours ago" is more useful than "Jan 14, 2026 5:32 PM"

### Axis Scaling:

- **Y-axis should start at zero** for bar charts to avoid exaggerating differences
- **Line charts may truncate** y-axis if zero isn't meaningful, but clearly indicate this
- **Avoid dual y-axes** unless absolutely necessary – they're often misleading
- **Round to appropriate precision** – Don't show "45.2367%" when "45%" suffices

### Interactive Charts:

- **Provide hover/click details** – Tooltips with exact values
- **Allow zooming and panning** for dense time series
- **Show loading states** – Don't display empty charts while data loads
- **Handle empty states** – Show helpful message when no data is available

### Chart Color Guidelines:

- Use **colorblind-safe palettes** – Avoid red/green only distinctions
- **Limit colors** – Max 5-7 distinct colors per chart
- Use **sequential colors** for ordered data (light to dark)
- Use **categorical colors** for unrelated categories
- **Highlight important data** – Use a distinct color for key metrics

---

## Form Design Best Practices

### Layout:
- **One column layouts** are easier to scan than multi-column
- **Group related fields** together with clear section labels
- **Logical order** – Follow natural sequence (name, email, phone, address)
- **Show only necessary fields** – Every additional field reduces completion rates

### Labels & Instructions:
- **Labels above fields** (not placeholder text as labels)
- **Keep labels short** – "Email" not "Please enter your email address"
- **Use helper text** for complex requirements (shown below the field)
- **Mark required fields** clearly – Use asterisk (*) or "(required)"

### Validation:
- **Validate on blur** – Check fields when user moves away, not on every keystroke
- **Show success states** – Green checkmark for valid fields
- **Preserve user input** on errors – Don't clear the form
- **Scroll to first error** on form submission

### Smart Defaults:
- **Pre-fill when possible** – Use known information (user's name, timezone)
- **Select sensible defaults** – Most common option should be pre-selected
- **Remember recent choices** – Especially for repeat workflows

### Checkbox & Toggle Semantics

**Checking a checkbox should ENABLE or ADD something, not disable it.** Negative framing increases cognitive load.

#### The Rule:
- ✅ **Checked = ON / Enabled / Active / Included**
- ❌ **Checked = OFF / Disabled / Excluded** (avoid this!)

#### Examples:

| ❌ Bad (Negative Framing) | ✅ Good (Positive Framing) |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| ☑️ "Disable notifications" | ☑️ "Enable notifications" |
| ☑️ "Hide advanced options" | ☑️ "Show advanced options" |
| ☑️ "Don't send me emails" | ☑️ "Send me email updates" |
| ☑️ "Exclude from search" | ☑️ "Include in search" |
| ☑️ "Opt out of tracking" | ☑️ "Allow usage analytics" |

#### Why This Matters:
- Users expect **checked = active/on** (mental model from light switches, etc.)
- Double negatives are confusing: "Uncheck to not disable" = ???
- Scanning a list of checkboxes should quickly show what's enabled

#### Checkbox vs. Toggle:
| Control | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| **Checkbox** | Multiple selections, opt-ins, settings that apply on form submit |
| **Toggle switch** | Binary on/off that takes effect immediately, single settings |

#### Toggle Labels:
- Put the label **before** the toggle, describing what it controls
- The toggle itself shows the state (on/off) — don't duplicate in the label
- **Good:** "Email notifications" [toggle]
- **Bad:** "Enable email notifications" [toggle] (redundant with on/off state)

---

## Interaction Feedback

### Users Need Feedback For:
- **Hover states** – Visual change when mouse is over interactive elements
- **Click/tap acknowledgment** – Button press animation, color change
- **Loading states** – Spinner, skeleton, progress bar for async operations
- **Success confirmation** – Visual confirmation that action completed
- **State changes** – Clear indication when something toggles on/off

### Loading States:
- **Disable interactive elements** while loading to prevent double-submission
- **Show progress** for file uploads and long operations
- **Provide cancel option** for long-running operations
